# Letter Grade
#### Respond to the following:

1. Write a plan for the following extension:
  * Attach a "+" on their grade if the grade ends in a 7, 8 or 9 (eg: 78 -> C+, 89 -> B+)
  * Attach a "-" on their grade if the grade ends in a 0, 1 or 2 (eg: 92 -> A-, 61 -> D-)

    * 


2. Discuss how you would make sure 100 is not misrepresented as an A-.
  * make a first special if for 100 in which it if the number grade is 100 or more it would add "A+" to an empty String and return just that.


3. Discuss how you would make sure grades that are an F are not mislabeled as F- or F+ (eg: 49 -> F+ and 52 -> F-)
  * Also make a special if which if a number grade is lower that 60 it would just add "F" to an empty string and just return the "F".
